Cloud functions deployment:
	- Required: nodejs & npm
	- npm install -g firebase-tools
	- firebase login
	- firebase deploy

	NOTE 1: You might need to add more memory to the createResolutions function if big pictures are uploaded
	NOTE 2: In the console is a bug that if you deploy cloud functions and don't refresh the settings page for the cloud functions it will load the previous deployment!!
